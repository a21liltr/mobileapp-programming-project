        <h1>About this app</h1>
        <p>
            This app was made for an assignment in "Webb Development - Programming Mobile Applications".
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been developed with a target group of "people who are bored but easily amused by the small things in life" in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pink and bright aesthetic of the theme is partly to shock the senses and partly to lighten the mood amidst a sometimes rather dull every day life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite being quite simple, the hope is that the randomness of the app will make both young and older people happy.
